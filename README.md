# Symptom-classification-bot
This is a simple AI project that works like a virtual assistant in a hospital. It asks you about your health problem (symptom), and based on your input, the AI classifies it into one of three categories:  General Problem (like fever, cold)  Emergency (like heart attack symptoms)  Mental Health (like stress or anxiety)
